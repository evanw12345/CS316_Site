                <h2>CS316-001 Project 3: Evan Wells</h2>
                <p>The internet sample has revolutionized society. There are many wonderful things accessable with the
                    internet. However, some users upload seemingly abstract content. Some of this content takes the form
                    of internet memes, abstract videos, and strange websites.</p>

                <h3>In this iteration of my CS 316 project,</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Admin tools page created.</li>
                    <li>Table detailing users' account information displayed there. For now, temporary data has been
                        filled in, but will eventually display users who have created accounts.</li>
                    <li>Login form added. Will eventually allow for individual
                        accounts based on username and password.</li>
                    <li>Added content upload form. Click the "&#43;" to access. Will eventually allow users who are
                        logged in to upload content to the site.</li>
                    <li>Refactored header to be included using jquery and added script to handle setting the class
                        "active" to the appropriate link in the nav bar</li>
